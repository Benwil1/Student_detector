The phenomenon of quantum entanglement represents one of the most intriguing aspects of modern physics. In this paper, we delve into the theoretical framework that governs the behavior of entangled particles. It is important to note that the correlation between these particles persists regardless of the distance separating them. Moreover, recent experiments have confirmed that the state of one particle is instantaneously linked to the state of another. In conclusion, quantum entanglement challenges our classical understanding of locality and causality, providing a pivotal foundation for future developments in quantum computing and secure communication.
