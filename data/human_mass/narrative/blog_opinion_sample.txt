OPINION - Published August 2018
I was wrong. Too much tech is ruining lives. Just four years ago, I was a cheerleader. Social media was supposed to be the great hope for democracy. I know because I told the world so. I said in 2014 that no one could predict where this revolution would take us. My conclusion was dusted with optimism: A better connected human race would find a way to better itself. I was only half right: Nobody could have predicted where we have ended up. Yet my optimistic prognosis was utterly misguided. Social media has led to less human interaction, not more. It has suppressed human development, not stimulated it. As Big Tech has marched onward, we have regressed.

We are seeing a generation that struggles with focus and real-world connection. I would say no to using smartphones as educational instruments for younger students (K-9), as I have seen these implemented and become a cause of distraction, rather than a tool for practical use. The increased use of smartphones could lead to distractions for students in the classroom, impacting their ability to synthesize complex information and engage in deep critical thinking. While technology offers contributions and advancements, its addictive nature and overuse can lead to negative consequences like media addiction and health issues.
