This action seeks declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent the implementation of the Department's proposed rule, which the Plaintiffs contend violates the Administrative Procedure Act. The Plaintiffs allege that the Department failed to provide adequate notice and opportunity for public comment and that the final rule is arbitrary and capricious. The Court finds that the Plaintiffs have demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits and that the public interest favors the issuance of a preliminary injunction.
