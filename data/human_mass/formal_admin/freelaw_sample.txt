The appellant argues that the trial court erred in admitting the witness's testimony over timely hearsay objections. Under the State's rules of evidence, hearsay is generally inadmissible unless it falls within a recognized exception. The court below found that the statements were made under the stress of a startling event and were therefore admissible as excited utterances. We review the court's evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion and find no such error in this case.
