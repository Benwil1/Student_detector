The history of science is the study of the development of science, including both the natural and social sciences (the history of the arts and humanities is termed history of scholarship). Science is a body of empirical, theoretical, and practical knowledge about the natural world, produced by scientists who emphasize the observation, explanation, and prediction of real-world phenomena.

The origins of Western science can be traced back to the Ancient Near East. In Mesopotamia, the Sumerians and Babylonians developed a sophisticated system of mathematics, using a sexagesimal (base-60) number system. They recorded astronomical observations on clay tablets, tracking the motions of planets and the timing of eclipses.

In prehistoric times, advice and knowledge were passed from generation to generation in an oral tradition. For example, the domestication of maize for agriculture has been dated to about 9,000 years ago in southern Mexico, before the development of writing systems. These early cultures observed the natural world for survival, such as tracking seasons and celestial events for planting and navigation.

The history of science also examines the social and cultural influences on the development of scientific thought. During the early modern period, the Scientific Revolution marked a significant shift in how people understood the world, moving from a reliance on ancient authorities to empirical observation and experimentation. This period saw the rise of individuals like Copernicus, Galileo, and Newton, whose work laid the foundation for modern physics and astronomy.
