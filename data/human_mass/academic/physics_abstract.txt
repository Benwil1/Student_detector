We report the discovery of a new class of topological insulators that exhibit quantized conductance in the absence of an external magnetic field. These materials are characterized by a non-trivial Berry phase and a robust band structure that is protected by time-reversal symmetry. Our experimental results, supported by density functional theory calculations, demonstrate the existence of edge states that are resilient to non-magnetic disorder, opening up new possibilities for the development of low-power electronic devices.
