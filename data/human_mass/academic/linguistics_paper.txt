The study of syntax examines the rules and principles that govern the structure of sentences in natural languages. Noam Chomsky's Universal Grammar theory posits that all human languages share an underlying structural framework that is innate to the human brain. This hypothesis has led to extensive research into the parameters that vary across languages and the cognitive mechanisms that enable children to acquire complex linguistic systems with minimal external input.
