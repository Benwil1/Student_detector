Abstract: The mitochondrial genome is a compact double-stranded circular DNA molecule that plays a critical role in energy production and cellular metabolism. Recent studies have highlighted the significance of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations in the pathogenesis of various metabolic and neurodegenerative disorders. However, the exact mechanisms by which these mutations influence cellular fitness and disease progression remain partially understood.

Methods: In this study, we analyzed the whole mitochondrial genomes of 500 individuals from a diverse cohort using high-throughput sequencing. We quantified the levels of heteroplasmy—the presence of more than one type of mitochondrial DNA within a cell—and assessed its correlation with clinical phenotypes. Statistical analyses were performed to identify significant associations between specific variants and metabolic markers.

Results: Our results demonstrate that heteroplasmy levels exceeding 20% in the ND5 and COI genes are strongly associated with altered mitochondrial respiration and increased oxidative stress. Furthermore, we identified a novel cluster of variants in the control region that appear to modulate the rate of mtDNA replication. These findings suggest that the functional impact of mtDNA mutations is highly dependent on both the specific variant and the overall proportion of mutated molecules.

Conclusion: These data provide further evidence for the role of mitochondrial genetic variation in human health and disease. Understanding the interplay between heteroplasmy and cellular physiology is essential for the development of targeted therapies for mitochondrial-related conditions.
