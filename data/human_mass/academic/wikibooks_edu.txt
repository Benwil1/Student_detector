In introductory psychology, the study of human development focuses on the physical, cognitive, and social changes that occur across the lifespan. From infancy to old age, individuals undergo a complex series of transformations that are shaped by both biological factors and environmental influences. Understanding these processes is essential for developing effective interventions to support healthy development at every stage of life.
