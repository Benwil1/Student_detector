This project aims to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, with a focus on the role of tau hyperphosphorylation in neuronal dysfunction. By utilizing a combination of advanced imaging techniques and biochemical assays, we hope to identify new therapeutic targets that can slow or prevent the progression of this devastating neurodegenerative condition.
