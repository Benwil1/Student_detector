The principle of marginal utility states that the satisfaction derived from consuming an additional unit of a good or service decreases as the total quantity consumed increases. This concept is fundamental to understanding consumer behavior and the determination of market prices in neoclassical economics. By analyzing the trade-offs that individuals make between different goods, economists can model how resources are allocated in a market economy to maximize overall utility.
