The CRISPR-Cas9 system has revolutionized genome editing by providing a versatile and precise tool for introducing targeted modifications into the DNA of diverse organisms. Derived from the adaptive immune system of bacteria, this technology utilizes a guide RNA to direct the Cas9 nuclease to a specific genomic locus, where it induces a double-strand break. Recent advancements have expanded the scope of CRISPR applications to include base editing, epigenetic modulation, and high-throughput genetic screens.
