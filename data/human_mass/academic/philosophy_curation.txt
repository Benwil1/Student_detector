Existentialism is a philosophical inquiry into the nature of the human condition, emphasizing individual freedom, responsibility, and the subjective experience of existence. Kierkegaard and Nietzsche provided the foundational critiques of traditional metaphysics, while Sartre and de Beauvoir developed the existentialist framework within the context of 20th-century social and political upheaval. The central tenet of existentialism is that existence precedes essence, meaning that individuals define their own meaning through their choices and actions.
