A 45-year-old male presented with a two-week history of progressive shortness of breath and a non-productive cough. Physical examination revealed fine bibasilar crackles and an oxygen saturation of 92% on room air. Laboratory investigations showed elevated inflammatory markers and a chest X-ray demonstrated patchy ground-glass opacities. Following a thorough diagnostic workup, the patient was diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and started on an appropriate treatment regimen.
