This repository ("Code - OSS") is where we (Microsoft) develop the Visual Studio Code product together with the community. Not only do we work on code and issues here, we also publish our roadmap, monthly iteration plans, and our endgame plans. This source code is available to everyone under the standard MIT license.

Visual Studio Code is a distribution of the Code - OSS repository with Microsoft-specific customizations released under a traditional Microsoft product license. Visual Studio Code combines the simplicity of a code editor with what developers need for their core edit-build-debug cycle. It provides comprehensive code editing, navigation, and understanding support along with lightweight debugging, a rich extensibility model, and lightweight integration with existing tools.

Visual Studio Code is updated monthly with new features and bug fixes. You can download it for Windows, macOS, and Linux on Visual Studio Code's website. To get the latest releases every day, install the Insiders build.

There are many ways in which you can participate in this project, for example:
- Submit bugs and feature requests, and help us verify as they are checked in
- Review source code changes
- Review the documentation and make pull requests for anything from typos to additional and new content

If you are interested in fixing issues and contributing directly to the code base, please see the document How to Contribute. This repository emphasizes high-quality code, rigorous testing, and clear documentation. We encourage contributors to follow our coding guidelines and participate in discussions on Stack Overflow or GitHub Discussions.
