The present invention relates generally to the field of wireless communication and more particularly to systems and methods for improving the efficiency of data transmission in high-density network environments. As the number of connected devices continues to grow, existing network protocols struggle to maintain low latency and high throughput, necessitating the development of new approaches to resource allocation and interference management.
