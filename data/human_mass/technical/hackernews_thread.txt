The real issue with current web frameworks isn't the performance of the rendering engine, but the complexity of state management. We've replaced simple server-side rendering with massive bundles of Javascript that are difficult to debug and even harder to maintain. I hope we see a return to more lightweight, declarative approaches that prioritize developer productivity and user experience over hype-driven development.
